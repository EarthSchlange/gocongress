  Join us for the
  = @year.ordinal_number.ordinalize
  Annual US Go Congress!
%p
  For thirty three years, the US Go Congress&mdash;the biggest, most
  exciting event of the year for American Go&mdash;has provided unique and
  memorable opportunities for go players to improve their game, make new
  friends, and learn from some of the best players in the world.

%p
  We are proud to announce that the 34th Go Congress will take place in
  %a{:href => "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamsburg,_Virginia"} Williamsburg, Virginia,
  on the campus of
  %a{:href => "http://www.wm.edu/"} William &amp; Mary,
  and will be hosted by the
  %a{:href => "http://nationalgocenter.org"} National Go Center.
  Come revisit the messy, fascinating history of the United States&rsquo;
  founding as we brazenly appropriate Patrick Henry&rsquo;s famous words for
  our own purposes: &ldquo;Give me liberties, or give me death!&rdquo;

%p
  Stay tuned for more details, and please email us if you have any questions,
  or if you&rsquo;re interested in volunteering. See you this summer!

%p
  &mdash; Your 2018 Directors,
