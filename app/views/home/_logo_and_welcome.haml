      It&rsquo;s time once again for Colorado to host the US Go Congress,
      which we have done every ten years since 1990! This time around we are
      pulling out all the stops and holding Congress in what we feel may be
      the most beautiful location ever. The YMC Camp at Estes Park is the
      perfect place for both players and non-players, young and old alike.
      It&rsquo;s an ideal vacation destination.

      The U.S. Go Congress is the largest go activity in the United States. It
      happens once a year and spans one week. Events include the U.S. Open, the
      largest annual go tournament in the U.S., professional lectures and game
      analysis, continuous self-paired games, and all kinds of go-related
      activities from morning to midnight. Come for the go. Come for the
      camaraderie of old friends. Whatever your reason, we are looking forward
      to seeing you there.
