# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# In 2011, we seeded the events and jobs.  Those records were modified on
# the live site, so the seeds in this file had become outdated.
# In 2012, hopefully we won't need any seeds.
# One can always create the initial admin account through the console.
