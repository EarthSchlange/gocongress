## Debugging the Application with `byebug`

First, include `byebug` at a point where you would like the execution to stop. For example,

```ruby

class HomeController < ApplicationController
  rescue_from ActionView::MissingTemplate, :with => :missing_template
  rescue_from ActionController::UnknownFormat, :with => :missing_template

  def index
    byebug
    @bodyClassList = "homepage"
    @slides = SlideSet.new(@year.year).slides_as_arrays
    @contents = Content.yr(@year).homepage.unexpired.newest_first
    @years = 2011..LATEST_YEAR
    @upcoming = CONGRESS_START_DATE[@year.year] >= Date.current
  end

...

```

Once that is done, `byebug` [ByeBug][24] can be used to debug the Go Congress application
from within the `gocongress_app` container, (The container should be created with
`docker-compose up app -d`). To do debug with `byebug` from termnal you can run `docker attach [container_id]`.
**Note: There may be nothing displayed in the ternimal until a `byebug` breakpoint is hit.**

## Configuration

`ENV` variables are stored in a `.env` file, which is git-ignored.
Most of these variables don't belong in source control because they
are secret. Others vary by deployment level. This file will be
loaded by the `dotenv` gem.

For local development, `cp .env.example .env` to get started.
For `stage` and `production` use [heroku config][2].
